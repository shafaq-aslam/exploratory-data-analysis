    "#### The shape of a data distribution refers to its overall pattern or form as it is represented on a graph. Some common shapes of data distributions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal Distribution**: A symmetrical and bell-shaped distribution where the mean, median, and mode are equal and the majority of the data falls in the middle of the distribution with gradually decreasing frequencies towards the tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skewed Distribution**: A distribution that is not symmetrical, with one tail being longer than the other. It can be either positively skewed (right-skewed) or negatively skewed (left-skewed).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute basic summary statistics for the column, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and quartiles. These statistics give a general understanding of the distribution of the data and can help identify skewness or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: Create visualizations to explore the distribution of the data. Some common visualizations for numerical data include histograms, box plots, and density plots. These visualizations provide a visual representation of the distribution of the data and can help identify skewness an outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifying Outliers**: Identify and examine any outliers in the data. Outliers can be identified using visualizations. It is important to determine whether the outliers are due to measurement errors, data entry errors, or legitimate differences in the data, and to decide whether to include or exclude them from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Skewness**: Check for skewness in the data and consider transforming the data or using robust statistical methods that are less sensitive to skewness, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings of the EDA and make decisions about how to proceed with further analysis.\n"
